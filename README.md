## üìã Prerequisites

- Azure subscription with appropriate permissions
- Microsoft 365 tenant with Exchange Online
- SharePoint site for storing Excel files
- Azure Automation Account
- Azure Storage Account
- App Registration with required API permissions

## üîß Setup Instructions

### Azure Automation Account Setup

For detailed instructions on setting up the Azure Automation Account, installing required modules, and configuring permissions, please refer to the comprehensive guide:

**üìñ [Complete Azure Automation Setup Guide](https://www.mscloudninja.com/pages/eventcalendarautomation.html)**

This guide covers:
- Creating and configuring Azure Automation Account
- Installing PowerShell modules (Microsoft.Graph, ImportExcel, ExchangeOnlineManagement)
- Setting up App Registration and certificate authentication
- Configuring required API permissions
- Setting up managed identity authentication

### Storage Account Configuration

#### 1. Create Azure Storage Account

1. Create a new Storage Account in Azure Portal
2. Choose **Standard** performance tier
3. Select **StorageV2 (general purpose v2)** account kind
4. Enable **Static website** hosting

#### 2. Configure Static Website

1. Navigate to your Storage Account
2. Go to **Settings** > **Static website**
3. Enable static website hosting
4. Set **Index document name**: `index.html`
5. Set **Error document path**: `index.html`
6. Note the **Primary endpoint** URL (e.g., `https://yourstorageaccount.z6.web.core.windows.net/`)

#### 3. Enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

To allow the web dashboard to access log files in the `logs` folder:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Resource sharing (CORS)**
2. Add a new CORS rule for **Blob service**:
   - **Allowed origins**: `*` (or specify your static website URL)
   - **Allowed methods**: `GET, HEAD, OPTIONS`
   - **Allowed headers**: `*`
   - **Exposed headers**: `*`
   - **Max age**: `3600`

#### 4. Set up Folder Structure

Create the following folder structure in the `$web` container:

```
$web/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ log-analyzer.html
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ logs/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (log files will be created here by the automation script)
```

### Web Dashboard Deployment

#### 1. Upload Web Files to Storage Account

1. **Upload `index.html`** to the root of the `$web` container
2. **Upload `log-analyzer.html`** to the root of the `$web` container

**Using Azure Storage Explorer:**
1. Download and install [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/)
2. Connect to your storage account
3. Navigate to `$web` container
4. Upload the HTML files

**Using Azure CLI:**
```bash
az storage blob upload --account-name <storage-account-name> --container-name '$web' --name index.html --file index.html
az storage blob upload --account-name <storage-account-name> --container-name '$web' --name log-analyzer.html --file log-analyzer.html
```

#### 2. Configure Azure Automation for Log Storage

Update the PowerShell script variables:

```powershell
# Storage Account configuration for Azure Automation logging
$StorageAccountName = "<YourStorageAccountName>"
$LogContainerName = "`$web"  # Static website container
$LogFolderPath = "logs"      # Folder within the container
```

#### 3. Set up Permissions

Ensure the Azure Automation Account's Managed Identity has the following role assignment on the Storage Account:
- **Storage Blob Data Contributor** role

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Using the Main Dashboard (index.html)

The main dashboard provides an overview of your automation system:

1. **Access the Dashboard**: Navigate to your static website URL (e.g., `https://yourstorageaccount.z6.web.core.windows.net/`)

2. **Dashboard Features**:
   - **Quick Stats**: View active runbooks, successful runs, warnings, and errors
   - **Critical Events**: See recent critical events and alerts from your automation runs

The log analyzer provides detailed log viewing and analysis capabilities:

1. **Access the Log Analyzer**: 
   - Click "Open Viewer" from the main dashboard, or
   - Navigate directly to `/log-analyzer.html`

2. **Log File Discovery**:
   - **Azure Storage (Production)**: Automatically discovers all `.log` files using Azure Storage REST API
   - **Local Testing**: Searches for specific log file patterns for development/testing

3. **Log Analysis Features**:

   - **Advanced Filtering**: Filter logs by level (ERROR, WARNING, INFO, SUCCESS) and search terms
   - **Intelligent Analysis**: Automatic identification of common issues and solutions
   - **Health Score**: Overall system health assessment based on log patterns
   - **Download Capability**: Download individual log files for offline analysis

4. **Understanding the Analysis**:
   - **Issues Detected**: The system identifies common patterns like distribution group failures, Graph API errors, and permission issues
   - **Solutions**: Each identified issue includes recommended solutions and troubleshooting steps
   - **Health Score**: Calculated based on error rates, warning patterns, and successful operations

### Excel File Format

Your SharePoint Excel file should contain the following columns:

| Column | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Subject | Event title | "Team Meeting" |
| StartTime | Event start date/time | "2025-09-25 09:00:00" |
| EndTime | Event end date/time | "2025-09-25 10:00:00" |
| AttendeeEmails | Comma-separated email addresses | "user1@company.com,group@company.com" |
| Location | Event location (optional) | "Conference Room A" |
| Body | Event description (optional) | "Monthly team sync meeting" |
| ShowAs | Calendar availability | "Busy" or "Free" |

## üìä Monitoring and Logging

### Log Storage

- **Location**: Logs are stored in the Storage Account under `$web/logs/`
- **Naming Convention**: `calendar-automation-log-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log`
- **Retention**: Configure retention policies as needed
- **Access**: Logs are accessible via the web dashboard and can be downloaded directly

### Log Levels

- **ERROR**: Critical issues that prevent event creation
- **WARNING**: Issues that might affect functionality but don't prevent execution
- **INFO**: General information about processing steps
- **SUCCESS**: Successful operations and confirmations

### Performance Monitoring

The system includes intelligent caching and performance statistics:

- **Address Cache**: Prevents redundant API calls for user/group lookups
- **API Efficiency**: Tracks cache hit rates and API call optimization
- **Retry Logic**: Intelligent retry handling for transient failures

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Log Files Not Appearing in Dashboard

**Symptoms**: Dashboard shows "No log files found" or "Scanning for critical events"

**Solutions**:
- Verify CORS is properly configured on the Storage Account
- Check that logs are being created in the correct `$web/logs/` folder
- Ensure the Automation Account has **Storage Blob Data Contributor** permissions
- Verify the static website is properly configured

#### 2. Distribution Group Lookup Failures

**Symptoms**: Errors like "couldn't be found on outlook.com"

**Solutions**:
- Verify the email addresses are correct in your Excel file
- Check Exchange Online permissions for the App Registration
- Ensure the distribution groups exist in your tenant
- The system will automatically fall back to treating these as individual user emails

#### 3. Microsoft Graph API Errors

**Symptoms**: "Request_UnsupportedQuery" or "Invalid expression" errors

**Solutions**:
- Review Graph API permissions in your App Registration
- Ensure **Calendars.ReadWrite**, **Directory.Read.All**, **User.Read.All**, and **Group.Read.All** permissions are granted
- Check that admin consent has been provided for all permissions

#### 4. Missing Files.Read Permission

**Symptoms**: Warnings about "permissions might be missing"

**Solutions**:
- Add **Files.Read** permission to your App Registration
- Grant admin consent for the new permission
- This permission is required for SharePoint file access

### Log Analysis Insights

The web dashboard provides intelligent analysis of your logs:

- **User Fallback Success**: When emails are processed as individual users (this is expected behavior)
- **Critical Issues**: Distribution group failures, Graph API errors, authentication problems
- **Performance Metrics**: Cache efficiency, API call optimization, processing times
- **Health Score**: Overall system health based on error patterns and successful operations
